## Data Preparation
1. Prepare data set for each city
2. Clean data for each city

```{r}
# Need to install this package first
# install.packages("stringi")
# install.packages("repr")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
# issue with this one
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(repr)
```

```{r}
# Choosing size of ggplot panels layout
options(repr.plot.width = 10, repr.plot.height = 5)
```

```{r}
# Function from the data_prep script

# a generic function to prepare data for a specific city, data_date
prepare_data <- function(city, data_date)
{
    # Cleaning listings dataframe
    
    # suppose raw data is stored in data_raw/city/data_date/listings.csv.gz

### Unit test : Reading data for malaga:
#### Preparing data, working âœ…

```{r}
# city <- "malaga"
# data_date <- "2020-06-30"
# prepare_data(city,data_date)
```

# Prepare data for all selected cities 

```{r}
# Reading cleansed data
cities <- c("malaga", "mallorca", "sevilla")
data_dates <- c("2020-06-30", "2020-09-19", "2020-06-29")

# We are only interested in data between min_date and max_date
min_date <- '2020-05-01'
max_date <- '2020-11-01'

files_paths <- c()
```

### Preparare data for Malaga, mallorca, sevilla

```{r}
for(i in 1:length(cities)){
    city <- cities[i]
    data_date <- data_dates[i]
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print(paste(c("Preparing data for", city, "compiled at", data_date), collapse = " "))
    prepare_data(city, data_date)
}

# Clean Environment
rm(list=ls())
```

```{r}
# Reading cleansed data
cities <- c("malaga", "mallorca", "sevilla")
data_dates <- c("2020-06-30", "2020-09-19", "2020-06-29")

# We are only interested in data between min_date and max_date
min_date <- '2020-05-01'
max_date <- '2020-11-01'

files_paths <- c()
```

### Read data in cities between min_date and max_date

```{r}
for(city in cities){
    file_dir <- file.path(".", "data_cleansed", city)
    file_subdirs <- list.dirs(file_dir)
    file_subdirs <- file_subdirs[-1]

    for(file_subdir in file_subdirs){
        if(file_subdir < file.path(file_dir, min_date) | file_subdir > file.path(file_dir, max_date)  )
            file_subdirs = file_subdirs[file_subdirs != file_subdir]
    }
    files_paths <- c(files_paths, file_subdirs)
}
files_paths <- file.path(files_paths, "listings.csv")
listings <- 
    do.call(rbind,
            lapply(files_paths, read.csv, row.names=1))
```

```{r}
summary(listings)
```

### Make a copy of the full dataset

```{r}
listings_full <- listings[complete.cases(listings), ]
```

### Preprocessing 

```{r}
listings$bedrooms <- ifelse(listings$bedrooms >= 5, "5+", listings$bedrooms)

# to do : break even point
# steps 1 : find the average price for the squarre meter in the city --> fixed costs 
# steps 2 : find the average price for the electricity and gas for --> variable costs 
# steps 3 : compute the break even point in day
```

```{r}
summary(listings)
```

## Example of analysis

```{r}
# Analysis 1
## Comparing the distribution of estimated revenue for the next 30 days of listings
## per each city.
p <- ggplot(listings, aes(city, revenue_30))
p + geom_boxplot(aes(colour = "red"), outlier.shape = NA) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = quantile(listings$revenue_30, c(0.1, 0.9), na.rm = T))
```

## Analysis 1 : comparing cities

#### 1. Find the "average availability over 30 days" of listings per each city

```{r}
avg_av <- aggregate(listings$availability_30, list(listings$city),mean)
```

```{r}
avg_av
```

#### 2. Find the "average revenue over 30 days" of listings per each city

```{r}
avg_rev <- aggregate(listings$revenue_30,list(listings$city),mean)
```

```{r}
avg_rev
```

#### 3. Compare the distribution of estimated availability for the next 30 days of listings per each city
[source](http://www.sthda.com/french/wiki/ggplot2-courbe-de-distribution-guide-de-demarrage-rapide-logiciel-r-et-visualisation-de-donnees)

```{r}
distrib_av <- ggplot(listings, aes(city, availability_30))
distrib_av + geom_boxplot(aes(colour = "red"), outlier.shape = NA) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = quantile(listings$availability_30, c(0.1, 0.9), na.rm = T))
```

#### 4. Compare the distribution of estimated revenue for the next 30 days of listings per each city

```{r}
distrib_rv <- ggplot(listings, aes(city, revenue_30))
distrib_rv + geom_boxplot(aes(colour = "red"), outlier.shape = NA) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = quantile(listings$revenue_30, c(0.1, 0.9), na.rm = T))
```

#### 5. Compare the distribution of estimated revenue for the next 30 days of listings per each city & for each house size (# of bedrooms)

```{r}
specified <- listings[complete.cases(listings), ]
distrib_rv_hsize <- ggplot(specified, aes(bedrooms, revenue_30))
distrib_rv_hsize + geom_boxplot(aes(colour = "red"), outlier.shape = NA) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = quantile(listings$revenue_30, c(0.1, 0.9), na.rm = T)) + 
    facet_wrap(~ city)
```

#### 6. Compare the distribution of estimated revenue for the next 30 days of listings per each city  & for each room type (room_type)

```{r}
distrib_rv_hsize <- ggplot(listings, aes(room_type, revenue_30))
distrib_rv_hsize + geom_boxplot(aes(colour = "red"), outlier.shape = NA) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = quantile(listings$revenue_30, c(0.1, 0.9), na.rm = T)) + 
    facet_wrap(~ city)+ 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Additional Analysis :
### Compute the break even point 

_Break Event Point_ : the point at which a business starts to make as much money as it has spent on a particular product, activity, etc
The BEP monitors how fast or how much money is required for the invest to make benefits : it is **widely used by managers to interpret the profitability of a product**, in our case : the profitability of the invest.

#### Calculation
$$Break Even Point = {\sum{Fixed Cost} \over Income â€“ VariableCostsPerUnit}.$$

* Fixed costs are costs that are not related to the activity
* Variable costs are costs related to the activity
* Income is the money earned


#### Additionnal Data :
In this particular case : 
* Fixed costs : Price of the Rent
* Variable costs : Electricity
* Income : Revenue over 365 days
Data extracted by this [website](https://www.combien-coute.net/)


|Ville| Sevilla  | Malaga | Majorqua  | 
|--|--|--|--|
|Square Meter| **2516.67 â‚¬** | **2842.86 â‚¬** | **3483.33 â‚¬** |
|Variable Expenses| **126.44 â‚¬** | **112.01 â‚¬** | **107.92 â‚¬**|

#### Consideration : 
For the ease of the data harvesting we consider that:
* the square meter price is even in each city
* the average size for a bedroom is 10 square meter
* each house as a lounge room of a size : ```1,5*number of room+7,5```
* the price of the electricity is the same for every house

### Bonus :
For each city :
- [ ] Fetch the price of squaremeter in each city : fixed cost
- [ ] Fetch the price of the electricity and water in each city : variable cost 
- [ ] Compute the breakeven point in days and in â‚¬ : Fixed Cost / (Income-variable cost)

### For the 3 cities

```{r}
cities <- c("sevilla","malaga", "mallorca")

    listings_full[bool_index, 'fixed_cost'] <- fixed_cost
    # Creating var costs column
    listings_full[bool_index, 'var_cost'] <- ((charges[i]/31) * (365-as.integer(listings_full[bool_index, ]$availability_365)))
    # Break Even Point in Year

}
```
